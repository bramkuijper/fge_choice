Here we develop an ecological model to assess whether choosy strains which resist beneficial FGEs can increase in frequency, while competing wi

## Strains and FGEs
We consider two types of foreign genetic elements (FGEs): the first FGE is denoted as $G_{1}$ and is modestly beneficial, as it provides protection against a single antibiotic. The second FGE is denoted as $G_{2}$ and is highly beneficial: it provides protection against the same antibiotic as $G_{1}$ does, but also against another antibiotic.

We assess the ecological dynamics of a 'choosy' strain (denoted by subscript $c$) that resists infection by the FGE $G_{1}$ with probability $\pi_{G_{1}}$, whereas it does not resist infections by the better FGE $\pi_{G_{2}} = 0$. Here, resistance reflects the probability that an FGE of type $G_{i}$ is detected and degraded by CRISPR (see also @Gandon2013).

The choosy strain is in competition with a promiscuous strain (denoted by subscript $p$) that has no resistance against either type of FGE. Let $S_{p}$ and $S_{c}$ then be the number of susceptible individuals of the promiscuous and choosy strain respectively, whereas $I_{pG_{i}}$ and $I_{cG_{i}}$ are the number of individuals of the promiscuous and choosy strain infected with an FGE of type $i$ where $i \in (1,2)$. 

## Dynamics
The change in numbers of individuals is then described by the following system of differential equations:
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}S_{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} &= b_{S} \left (0 \right ) \left(1 - \kappa N \right ) S_{p} + \gamma_{G_{1}} I_{G_{1}} + \gamma_{G_{2}} I_{G_{2}} - \left [ d + \psi_{G_{1}} + \psi_{G_{2}} \right ] S_{p} (\#eq:dSpdt) \\
%
\frac{\mathrm{d}S_{c}}{\mathrm{d}t} &= b_{S} \left ( \pi_{G_{1}} \right ) \left(1 - \kappa N \right ) S_{c} + \gamma_{G_{1}} I_{G_{1}} + \gamma_{G_{2}} I_{G_{2}} - \left [ d + 
  \left (1-\pi_{G_{1}} \right ) \psi_{G_{1}} + \psi_{G_{2}} \right ] S_{c} \\
  %
\frac{\mathrm{d}I_{p G_{i}}}{\mathrm{d}t} &= b_{G_{i}}(0) \left ( 1 - \kappa N \right ) I_{p G_{i}} + \psi_{G_{i}} S_{p} - \left [ d_{G_{i}} + \gamma_{G_{i}} \right ] I_{G_{i}} \quad \text{for }i\in(1,2)\\
%
\frac{\mathrm{d}I_{c G_{1}}}{\mathrm{d}t} &= b_{G_{1}}\left( \pi_{G_{1}} \right ) \left ( 1 - \kappa N \right ) I_{c G_{1}} + \left ( 1 - \pi_{G_{1}}\right ) \psi_{G_{1}} S_{c} - \left [ d_{G_{1}} + \gamma_{G_{1}} \right ] I_{c G_{1}} \\
%
\frac{\mathrm{d}I_{c G_{2}}}{\mathrm{d}t} &= b_{G_{2}}\left( \pi_{G_{1}} \right ) \left ( 1 - \kappa N \right ) I_{c G_{2}} +  \psi_{G_{2}} S_{c} - \left [ d_{G_{1}} + \gamma_{G_{1}} \right ] I_{c G_{1}} 
\end{align}
where $N$ is the total population size, $N = S_{c} + S_{p} +I_{pG1} + I_{pG2} + I_{cG1} + I_{cG2}$. An individual of type $y$ which expresses resistance probability $x$ against $G_{1}$ reproduces at rate 
\begin{align}
b_{y} \left ( x \right ) = F_{y} \mathrm{exp}\left( - c x \right),
\end{align}
where $F_{y}$ is a parameter that reflects how fecundity is affected by an individual's current state and the antibiotic treatment.  The exponential function reflects how resistance $x$ against the $G1$ FGE reduces fecundity, scaled by the cost of choosiness parameter $c$. In the system of equations \@ref(eq:dSpdt), promiscuous individuals that express no choosiness have $x=0$.

## Different antibiotic treatments
When individuals are exposed to an environment without antibiotic, we have $F_{S} > F_{G1} > F_{G2}$  as we assume that carrying an FGE comes at a net cost in the absence of an antibiotic. 

When individuals are exposed to a single antibiotic to which $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ both provide protection, we have $F_{G1} \geq F_{G2} > F_{S}$
 
When individuals are exposed to a single antibiotic to which only $G_{2}$ provides protection, we have $F_{G2} > F_{S} > F_{G1}$

When individuals are exposed to a mixture of antibiotics to which only $G_{2}$ provides protection, we have $F_{G2} > F_{S} > F_{G1}$
